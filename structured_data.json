Me and Aryan Agarwal started Yenmo (YC W24) in a small cabin that could barely fit the two of us. Having first hand seen how loan companies treat their customers, we dreamed of a building a loan company that prioritised ethical practices over revenue. We hoped to disburse crores worth of loans and allow people access to low cost credit lines. The last year has seen so many of our dreams come true.\n\nWe've now onboarded some incredible people to back us as we move forward in this journey. While we pitched Yenmo to multiple people, we also realised the kind of people we wanted to see on our board and I cannot be more excited with the set of folks we have with us. This round has participation from ZAKA VC Pioneer Fund Team Ignite Ventures Y Combinator and some incredible angels including Olivier Port√©, Laurent Benhamou. \n\nThis fundraise raise allows us to move more confidently towards our goal of building India's first good loan company. Our motto is always providing low cost loans, not asking for unnecessary data or permissions from our customers and have a customer support team that is always respectful. We also have some more exciting products that we would be launching soon. \n\nYenmo (YC W24) Aryan Agarwal",

At Yenmo, we believe there is a better way to lend money. It shouldn't be with interest rates that burn a hole in your pocket, it shouldn't be pestering customers with calls and messages. Instead, it should be affordable, accessible, and with the highest priority being customer satisfaction. We hope to bring a modern way of lending which promotes healthy financial behavior. A behavior in which customers end up increasing their networth despite taking a loan.
